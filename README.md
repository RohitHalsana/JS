You can open the individual project folders directly in your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text).
```
# Usage

Navigate to the /js-notes folder to find the notes for each JavaScript concept.
Open each project folder under /projects to find the complete code along with explanations.
Follow the README files inside the project folders for setup and usage instructions.

Notes & Learning Resources
The notes folder is divided into three sections:

# Basic: Learn foundational JavaScript concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and arrays.
Intermediate: Explore deeper topics like object-oriented programming, error handling, and event-driven programming.
Advanced: Dive into modern JavaScript features like promises, async/await, and functional programming patterns.
Each note is written in a simple, understandable language with examples to aid your learning.

# Projects
Here are a few projects included in the repository:

Project 1: Todo List Application: A simple app for managing tasks. Learn DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage.
Project 2: Weather App: Fetch weather data from an API and display it dynamically using JavaScript.
Project 3: Calculator App: Build a simple calculator app using JavaScript and understand the logic behind arithmetic operations and event handling.
Each project is a step-by-step guide with accompanying code.
